# . Practice Questions 
#  A. Short Questions 
# 1. What is the difference between = and ==? 
# = = means equal to in comparison operation for example 5==5 while = m
# 2. What is the output of 10 % 3?
# let the variables be; 
a=10
b=3
# % is the modulus sign and we only consider the remainder as the answer
print (a%b) 
# 3. Write an example using the not operator
# not reverses the boolean value 
# example
v=True
y=False
print(not(y)) #giving the results as true
print(not(v)) #giving the result as false since the answers are given in a reverse format
# . What will this print be? 
a=4
b=2
print(a**b//b)
#the results will be 8 this is because;
a**b
